# VS Code Problem Matcher Example

This project demonstrates how to display custom warnings or errors in VS Code's _Problems_ tab.

It accompanies my blog post, [VS Code: Display Custom Warnings in the Problems Tab](https://taurit.pl/vs-code-custom-warnings/).

## How to Use

Build the project (typically with the **F6** keyboard shortcut).

This launches a small C# program that writes warnings and errors to the console. Custom warning and error messages will then appear in the _Problems_ tab, and VS Code will stop the build task.
