# VS Code Problem Matcher Example

This project is a minimal VS Code Workspace demonstrating how to display custom warnings or errors in VS Code's _Problems_ tab.

## How to use

Build this project (typical keyboard shortcut: **F6**).
You'll see the build start by launching a small C# program that writes warnings and errors to the console.
These messages will automatically appear in the _Problems_ tab, and VS Code will stop the build task.
